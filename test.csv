external movement  back in the early s having microsoft on your resume would open doors while its still relatively true recruiters from fb goog amzn will always try to recruit you getting into smaller companies is hard i had a few interviews that had a clear bias towards my experience because microsoft was seen to be old school in their software development practices  the lifers  sensitive topic but there are some folks who basically understand the security of their job at microsoft see pro there are several people who are waiting for retirement and are working  am  pm hours this is hard because they tend to resist any change or are nonresponsive if you email them at  pm its hard to feel everyone has a shared passion for what theyre working on  the ball drop  ultimately somebody down the chain drops the ball a project with a ton of passionate engineers delivers but the hardware team drops the ball and creates garbage or a perfect device but marketing creates these commercials that look like something my  year old made or a great platform with no ecosystem because the developer tools are hard to use  the rat race  at some point in my  years i subscribed to the idea of get promoted otherwise im not growing because the entire pay grade and responsibility is tied to your level its somewhat true but when people start working the system they are merely trying to get promotions visible projects taking on responsibilities at the next level and not deliver solid work at their current level ive seen projects where senior engineers were off trying to find things to get them to principle while they let their sdes and sde s architect the project the code was a mess and i was surprised it didnt deadlock more often but these are things that could have been fixed if their seniors architected the project instead of making them do the crossteam integration work not great if those engineers want to code but are being forced into pmish sort of roles its easy to get sucked into the need of perpetual promotionsfoundation  microsoft is a great place to learn and to explore sure the first year of employment youll be trying to figure out our process around planning developing testing code reviews checking in code opening bugs tracking bugs to builds build process talking to others in a diplomatic manner but youll learn how software is delivered and be able to articulate it microsoft is good at formalizing workflows which is good if youve never worked with a large team youll think of things from security efficiency even variable and method names for public apis they have a team dedicate to reviewing and teaching you  structure  if youre a fan of process and structure theres a lot some people hate it but if you ask why instead of complain youll often see a reason and if not you can always find ways to improve it  movement  microsoft is huge and work on many things the benefit of being able to transfer teams to learn new things is amazing i started working at microsoft on the front end of some silly application that no longer exists a year later i was working on the kernel drivers of their embedded platform  security  youll always be able to pay your bills theres only ever been one layoff in my  years at microsoft that has shocked me benefits are spectacular  flexible  as structured as the process goes managers are always willing to be flexible on hours its great for life balance as the demand of life outside of work changes  new parents family health issues when my child was born i would be out at  and work remotely after my kid was in bed  every team at microsoft varies on the structure and culture something will usually fit youreflecting on a decade	__label__4.0

* tldr microsoft is a boring stodgy place thats longterm career suicide for a talented inspired young person satya is changing things but not remotely to the extent the press narrative claims join microsoft if you need a steady boring job so you can raise a family  or if you dont have better options  dont come here if youre genuinely excited about being part of the next wave of technological innovation or if you care about being at a fun cool place to work this aint it *  when you see positive glassdoor reviews for working at microsoft you should ask whether the reviewer has actually worked anywhere else microsoft typically hires people right out of college who dont yet realize theyre getting a bum workplace experience relative to our industry peers its not a coincidence that almost never will you meet people voluntarily departing a toptier tech company like google apple or facebook to work for microsoft  even though countless ms employees leave daily to these competitors  why is that microsoft has  major flaws for a young person excited about tech   if you are young and inspired doing microsoft longterm is career suicide  microsoft is a fine place to go for  years out of college to learn a new discipline  especially if you didnt get the gpa to go straight to a toptier tech company like google or uber  but microsoft is a terrible place to stay for the long term  unless you really just want to have kids a suburban house and just need a day job to pay for all that doing a longterm stint at microsoft destroys your marketability you will have to fight in every interview to prove that you can survive in the agile autonomous resourceconstrained androidios environment that is the real world companies will assume the worst of you in every interview when youre ready to leave it gets degrading fast  yeah you ship windows and office to a billion people big impact opportunity right well mcdonalds ships about  billion hamburgers each year wouldnt a job in mcdonalds headquarters also be a big impact opportunity and if your idea of innovation involves years of making incremental tweaks to the big mac recipe or wasting  years of your life to bring some executives insane vision of a hybrid ice cream  chicken sandwich to market sure  and the financial buffer of working at a monopoly means you burn  years of your working life on a single preventable fiasco like windows  or vista during which your silicon valley friends just had the time of their life and got filthy rich helping create uber or airbnb instead youll be working on ridiculous projects that only make sense to microsoft executives living in a suburban redmond bubble you will be the butt of jokes at parties with your college friends when you try to explain what youre working on wait so its kindof like an ipad but it has worse hardware specs no software its buggy as hell and its more expensive than the ipad   you dont get to make a dent in the world  at microsoft you really wont change the world not a bit you will waste months of your life trying to get organizational buyin to do what would take days or even hours at a silicon valley startup  microsoft is not a company that goes out and makes things better for customers just out of employees own passion or conviction there is no love in the microsoft workplace culture  it really feels like working at a fading monopoly whose primary mission is to figure out how to keep cranking out bucketloads of cash in a new reality that no longer needs it  this is what makes microsoft such a boring and soulless place to work youll find soullessness in the dull corporate posters in the hallways the bland workspaces and the uninspired cafeteria food and with the cloudy dark skies making for dark and depressing openseating workspaces microsofts last great perk of private offices is being phased out it can sometimes feel like a reallife reenactment of apples  commercial  microsoft does an amazing job selling interns on the company  amazing parties food concerts free hardware and lots of executive facetime if youre an intern enjoy every moment of it but remember that youll never get any of that once you work for the company  all youre getting is a sales demo   microsoft is a traditional hierarchical company  while tech companies are typically egalitarian and flat microsoft is traditional and hierarchical this hierarchical workplace manifests in big ways and in little ways  in little ways it just makes for a lousy work environment in every email you send your job title and tenure rank junior vs midlevel vs senior appears at the bottom so people can judge your ideas by your rank  just like the military it means they serve the worst food of any tech company since executives get personally catered meals and dont have to eat the dogfoodquality lunches food themselves and it explains why the shuttle service that takes you around campus is a timesucking nightmare  executives have special  shuttles that actually work  and in big ways this means that if you have a great idea youre probably not going to get it into a product  unless its specifically your job or charter to do so microsoft doesnt want you for your creativity  they want you for your ability to shut up and execute on other peoples executives ideas  in fairness there are small improvements like the new annual hackathon yes for just a few days each year your original ideas and your creativity are valued but there are other companies where your ideas and conviction are valued every single day   microsoft doesnt care about you  your immediate manager may care about you but microsoft as a company doesnt microsoft wont even do an exit interview when you quit when you give notice that youre leaving for a competitor basically any tech company worth its salt you literally are escorted out the door your health care and paycheck is also terminated that very same day  hr interview nope youll receive a survey that you literally cant even fill out  because it expires the moment your ms email account shuts down doh they literally dont care why you left  it sounds brutal but microsoft at its core is traditionally an unkind company until recently they even required managers to give bad reviews to roughly  of their teams on a forced curve stack ranking when they ended this management practice microsofts leadership never even had the humility to acknowledge or admit that this was ever a bad idea or unjustly hurt employees  working at microsoft also means youre also stuck in seattle competitors like google let you work as an engineer in almost any exciting city in the world new york munich london san francisco  you name it they have an office there at microsoft well you better love redmond at least its only a  minute bus trip during rush hour to seattle  while companies like google lavish new toys and freebies on employees microsoft is dirt cheap with employees the only free hardware i got was a junky surface rt promised by ballmer to be free but then we had to agree in writing that it was actually the companys property and would be returned if we left and a windows phone which was only free if we signed up for a nearly  contract at the employees sole expense  despite the unambiguous promise steve ballmer made at the company meeting of a free phone and true to microsoft they never explained or apologized for not actually giving employees what they promised us  as an ms employee youre generally expected to just shut up and be grateful for whatever you get  microsoft seeks to be a hardware maker but offers marginal discounts to employees at best you can get a better price on the internet for an xbox or surface whereas apple gives employees  off a new mac microsoft gives you nothing like that microsoftlogod clothing at the company store costs as much as actual fashionable majorbrand merchandise at a major clothing store  this isnt necessarily a problem as a noteworthy sign of the companys downward relevance is that almost nobody will ask you to buy ms discounted products anymore certainly not compared to when i started  it just goes on and on  overall microsoft isnt horrible  but if youre a talented young person who wants to make a dent in the universe dont come to microsoftrelatively stable employment reasonable compensation for local area relatively smart people and

i spent a lot of years at microsoft the exact number of years is irrelevant but looking back i deeply regret how many years i have lost to really not doing anything substantial ie changing the world i will try to provide some insights to help you decide  you wont ship a thing in years  i have been in teams which have not shipped anything externally for years most of the work is lost either because the product is shelved or because the sponsor of the project vanished everyone in microsoft knows when to jump off a sinking boat really well  new leadership  the new ceo is doing a lot of good things but things continue to be the same internally most changes that are pushed down remain in the news for a few weeks and are then conveniently forgotten they are done because the ceo wants it to be done that way no one really believes in it but since they have to protect their jobs they will pretend to adhere they just do it because they were asked to  no of engineers vs work available  with about  people in rd and limited product lines windows bing office xbox sql azure to name a few honestly there are more engineers than the work available in the company most teams reinvent the wheel by doing the same projects across different orgs this is what i did and saw many other teams do in my long tenure with the company we used to do exactly the same work that was already done by some other team often knowing that it was already attempted and to make it worse we would leave the work half baked so that some other team would again do the same thing in the future  complacency  no one questions anything because they just want to get their paycheck and continue happily  no worthy competitors in the neighborhood  there is absolutely no other big company in and around redmond which could absorb microsoft employees and also pay the same salaries this creates a terrible situation employees dont want to move out of microsoft as they cannot find a job that pays as much honestly many employees are also afraid they will not be able cope up with the high demands of jobs at other companies thats the bitter truth whether anyone confesses it or not  no goodwill for other development centers  i will keep this short there is not much goodwill in hq redmond for other possibly more efficient global development centers my managers and their bosses would do everything possible to malign the efforts of other development centers and create as many obstacles as possible to make their work look bad  devtestcombined engineering  the devtest orgs continue to be the pillars of the company but with the latest combined engineering model things have started to deteriorate as an example look at reviews of the office products which calls them halfbaked  quality is nonexistent at microsoft nowadays  performance appraisals  earlier there was a rating system which was a good thing because you knew your trajectory if you got good ratings over a few cycles it would create a good pressure to get you promoted the rating system was eliminated a year ago and now there is no indication of when your next promo might happen or how is the employee trending it is just a continuum and you can stay in that limbo state as long as you wish to  poor end user products  to top it all the company makes poor products i know you are thinking why did i spend so much time in the company when i think so poorly about their products to be honest i tried my best to improve them when i was around but i could barely make a dent compared to other companies it is difficult to rely on microsoft products say in a life and death situation for ex with your smartphone  already many teams are loosing revenue to other software companies that are selling free software this has lead to massive layoffs it wont be long before the remaining customers move to these new platforms please note that these customers purchased microsoft products mostly because they did not have a choice at that time now they do brand value to some extent  microsoft still commands decent brand value outside so if you have clocked a good number of years specially as an full time employee it does have some weightage   lots of real estate and large office spaces redmond city is pretty much built around microsoft offices  compared to other companies cramming their employees on floors microsoft has many buildings and most employees get a room by themselves this is changing though with many teams moving to open floor plans if you are in redmond the commute is awesome your office would be  minutes from your home   good hiring bar which leads to intellectual peers and team mates  i think this is the best part a lot of candidates get rejected and the bar is pretty high because of this only the creme makes it into the company   good perks specially the healthcare benefits and stock options you get in every appraisal cycledeeply regret the precious years of my life that i lost working at microsoft	__label__4.0

a lot of mundane work that you need to get out of the way before you have time to look at the big picture and strategize your work these include a lot of process overhead there are probably good reasons for them but they take away time otherwise could be spent on innovation and collaboration advice be really quick with the mundane stuff and spend as much energy as possible on the strategy and prioritization everything is kept in sharepoint and by default permission is denied so a lot of wasted time finding the right documents and more wasted time tracking down document owners and asking for access despite the attempt to turn around the hero culture and despite the push for more collaboration the word collaboration at microsoft means something different from what i understand it means coming from silicon valley the hero culture is in the way people arent willing to let go of ideas that they can take credits from even though its not the best idea despite the nominally new performance review system the old spirit of stackranking remains managers simply change names of what they call the different tiers of performers the function of how well the company perceives your performance is in large part how much your manager is willing to fight for you and how much political capital shehe has in the calibration meeting the only true way to transform this culture is to stop the individual bonus and to give bonus at the team level the number one priority is revenue not the users which encourages shorttermism and stifles innovation  or maybe i was on a wrong teama big emphasis on investing in people if youre a winner youll keep winning all you need to rise to the top is keep being in the top performer pool then its easier to succeed because you have more visibility and you get first pick of projects a lot of money microsoft has the cash to fund your bold projects as long as the business plan that you propose is solid the new cafeteria have good foods and ambience good benefits including my favorite of matching charitable givingsact or be acted upon	__label__5.0

its very charming to join microsoft but the consulting practice specially the public sector services practice is not the best place to join at least based on my own personal experience if you are looking to work for microsoft and want to grow your career try to join the other business and product groups  consultants are expected to work on multiple projects to meet sometimes difficult utilization goals and held accountable even if their main job is to deliver and not sell you will be expected to travel  instead of complementing the great products microsoft makes there is too much focus on quantity then quality which is doing nothing but hurting the microsoft brand  you will not be rewarded for your extra contributions and keeping customers happy and helping grow the business even if you miss on a single negligible operationaladministration commitment microsoft has done away with the stack ranking model but unfortunately some leadership in the consulting practice is still using this modelmicrosoft provides you with plenty of opportunities to grow your career you can move from one business practice to another if you feel another job may be a better fit for your career ambitions you get a lot of training opportunities to sharpen both your technical and soft skills access to many online training and research materials for technical and sales specific roles good pay and benefits and msdn subscription great campus environment and learning facilities lots of technical and social events to network and mingle with your fellow microsoft employees and leadershipgreat company but avoid the consulting services practice	__label__4.0

i worked nearly  years at microsoft and always looked forward with optimism to working with intelligent dedicated hard working coworkersleaders and on cool projects however i mainly i saw poor middle management dysfunctional teams constant reorgs back stabbing empire building and cost cutting that during my time i was reduced in force twice on two teams the first time i landed a new team and never left the company the second time i wasnt given such luxurydespite getting s and s and promos over the last few years  i left ms with a bitter feeling that i never found what i was looking for i met some very intelligent people but seemingly most had significant character flaws that were disastrous to building high performing teams what frustrated the most was the constant empire building and self preservation that occurred at middle and upper management levelsbasically what they tell you is just lip service to make you feel good but no substance not uncommon at big corporations so that shouldnt be a surprise  before my second rif i had two teams interested in having me move but my last gm pleaded on two occasions that i not leave so thinking i was favored by him that would mean a brighter future so i stayedyet not  months later i was axed with  other coworkers best i could figure is that we werent diversified enough to keep despite all being top team performers with important projects not sure who or how the layoff decision was made but from my perspective when you have common traits as far as gender race sexual orientation you dont stand a chance if you are in competition with the more uncommon folks working next to you even if they perform worse honestly  individuals on that team who could be classified as diverse had either delivered nothing of important in years stayed in the same role for many years or actually screwed up to cost the company money probably not an unusual situation at large corporations since meeting certain diversification requirements are important to someone up high so for me its time to move on to a smaller companycompensation and benefits some projects you have to be very pushy to get the interesting work and work life balance if you have management support always had a sense of pride working at microsoftoptimistic but disappointed	__label__4.0

in general theres more work to be done than fits in an  hour day for nearly  years i generally worked a hr day  days a week with another half day accumulated across evenings or weekends  the annual review process imposes a ranking across team members which is not representative of how well they did their jobs this can lead to deflated compensation and advancement opportunities for individuals who are doing their job well and vice versa can advance employees who dont deserve it simply because they did better work than their team mates who were less competent this process is slowly changing but i have no insight as to what and when new policies will be in placemicrosoft continues to expand its portfolio of software and hardware products providing development positions in a very wide variety of technologies and areas of interest  although flagship products have a very large organization size individual working teams are small providing crossdiscipline fraternity within the larger context  the working environment is casual with respect to dress codes and personal communication work hours are flexible  commute options are plentiful if you drive theres ample parking while microsoft bus or city transit covers much of the greater seattle areawork environment at microsoft in software development teams	__label__5.0

cons will vary by division so my experiences may not be representative of all  or most  groups within the the advertising groups  ie in osd or ao microsoft is victim to a very subtle passiveaggressive culture that seems somewhat pervasive of a lot of companies in the seattle area so not just a ms phenomena disagreements or direct confrontation is frowned upon while back channel negotiations and positioning drive influence if you prefer a culutre that is far more direct and vocal microsoft may not be a great environment or experience for you promotions and advancement can be very slow unless you have an acceptable alpha dog personality and or othereise are a strong contributor and belong to high profile demographic groups if you dont fit these categories make sure you get a level and salary you will be happy with when you start for at least two years or more as you will very likely not be considered for promotions until your second or third review unless you stand out like a rock star smaller companies reward and promote much quicker so if you are used to or expect that you may be disappointed while microsoft makes much of its meritbased promotionsrewards system its really difficult to believe it this is the problem of any large company where promotion and reward decisions are made further and further up the org hierarchy so its just really difficult for all but the most signifciant or narcisitic to get noticed this means that employees who consistently deliver good work but dont generate a lot of awareness can often be overlooked the lack of transparency around levels is one of the problems imo promotions are secretive and not acknowledged in most groups which is kind of weird and doesnt lead to a lot of trust in a system if management is not willing to acknowledge who gets promoted and who does not the work you do may be exciting but there is a  to  month cycle where the projectproduct you are working on will go from high profile to mundane or as seen recently a target for personnel reductions this leads to one of the solutions and problems at microsoft in that you are going to have to change internal jobs frequently to stay relevant eg  months to  years there is little value placed on consistent results generation microsoft wants rock stars who will generate internal enthusiasm and garner resources and rewards which leads to a sort of selffulfilling prophecy until they ultimately flame out see xbox one launchas many have stated the benefits and pay at microsoft are mostly without compare a healthy dose of worklife balance and a solid set of benefits made this an attractive place to work for many new and midcareer people recent changes to the review model is a huge step towards treating employees with the dignity and respect that they deservegreat benefits limited upward mobility and opportunity	__label__3.0

i should preface this by saying microsoft like every giant corporation depends enormously on where you land if you know the people youll be working with its a great opportunity i rolled the dice to become an fte and that was a huge mistake there are segments of this company that are  years behind the industry  its easy to convince yourself that you had an influence but as a service engineer you wont y theyll interview you and ask if you can code if you can find another job once youre hired you can expect to never code again i even had managers get angry with me when i simply checked in fixes to problems myself i was subjected to  months of constant reorganizations with almost no work requested of me during this time it was maddening my team was put on death watch for a collection of old serviceskilled by nadella but rightfully so so there i was as a top performer in my level stuck patrolling a product cemetery while my former product group plowed forward into new and shiny things this is because microsoft only respects devs not ses not testers and maybe not even pms as an se your opinion and your leaderships opinion will never matter unless someone with a developer title agrees with you the job a service engineer is to absorb the technical debt of your development team i found myself in this job getting paid more than ever while people expected less than ever of me it was a depressing demoralizing year and i am delighted to be paid more for doing more elsewhere my resume grew almost none other than the value of their nameits a blast to work at scale as a systems engineer  and chances are this is as big a scale as youll ever operate managing global scale incidents and being a part of delivering a really big product is exciting you will hone some skills here but just what they are will depend entirely on where you end upa great place to be a dev a terrible place to be a service engineer	__label__3.0

my main criticism is that it is not a company that values women in the workplace i have not observed women getting promoted and women from technical fields are rarely being hired teams remain disproportionately male even compared to recent statistics from google and other competitors little effort is made to proactively recruit women in technical positions managers from my division regularly and openly discredit women they bully them from my personal experience it feels like anchorman over there the maternityparental benefits are bs i took them and it cost me a poor review i was doing great before and in all prior reviews  if you are in my situation know that a lot of tech companies are proactively hiring women publishing their statistics as cause for change and rewarding women for their good technical work the underlying belief in other companies is that women have equal capacity to be technical and do technical work this is not the case at microsoft credit is frequently given to male coworkers on the basis of their arrogance and posture the presumption is that technical contributions in collaborations come from men this is promoted by managers at many levels for instance women are frequently required to justify more of the technical claims on patents then their male counterparts on similar patents the presumed inequality is part of everyday engagements  real equal opportunity teams may exist in the company just be sure to interview your future microsoft colleagues and understand the culture you are going into i have excellent offers in other places now and i am taking the one that best fits my personality and values i know i will have a great impact there i just wished i had moved out sooner from an environment that was toxic for my health  there is no collaboration possible and unless you are a very vocal person and snarky to a fault more arrogant people steal the credit for your work i have struggled with this lack of collaboration and very competitive atmosphere i was hoping that with the nokia integration a more collaborative culture would influence microsoft leaders but unfortunately it did not happen and all of those guys got fired anyway  regarding the interview process the recruiter really tries to lowball you compared to other companies this was my experience interviewing initially and then later interviewing internally crap tactics like acting baffled and surprised at basic packages offered by many of their competitor companies are the norm can they understand more collaborative techniques and work together on a good package they do not reward phds they do not reward the caliber of the institution youre coming from it is because most of the management lack graduate education and believe education is useless i heard it many times at work  a minor thing no free food and food becomes quite expensive if you have only minutes to eat and need to eat in the local expensive cafeteria in the commons about  a lunch something to budget  the culture is really engraved in every manager who has been there from the start of course you can find an excellent team it does exist and if the work is a good fit go for it be sure to probe the teams culture and get to know who will be your skip levelgood benefits even though health care is becoming expensive amazing talks at microsoft research mainly by invited guests huge company so there is the possibility to change roles quite easily the pay is quite good especially because the main location is in wa great bus that brings you all over campus some new cool microsoft devicesarrogant culture no collaboration bullying management and not an equal opportunity employer	__label__4.0

your experience will vary between teams but one thing that was consistent for me at least is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes though i had the opportunity to work on some popular products the only way i could ever get my work done according to expectations is if i stayed late in the day most of the time was spent in meetings dealing with build processes iterating specs with the team answering literally hundreds of emails a day helping test team troubleshoot issues  unfortunately a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload and in those cases where it does its almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take since it relies on your entire team to work  efficiently i believe worklife balance is actually possible here but its only at the expense of getting a positive review accountability is important but most of the time it felt like i was taking the blame or being punished for someone elses poor performance on the team at the same time you dont want to point fingers because it makes you look equally bad really the only time i was happy was when i was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule or i was on a team with no slackers sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload say if they were more junior people in their role and management would expect you to help them do their job but would not properly account for this in the estimates  over time i eventually learned to manage these things better with politics yes people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem but at microsoft the politics are significantly magnified people are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy therein lies the true problem i eventually left microsoft since it felt like most of my time almost  was spent politicking and handling processes coupled with a decrease quality in the products the gradual results of their work environment and a lot of other good people leaving the company microsoft seemed to be going downhill  though enterprise and azure have really taken off recently i dont think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of windows revenue in the end surface was an unfortunate flop and windows phone  bing are sucking money from the company xbox  was doing great when i left but now even xbox one is looking like a poor performer which is really concerning for the company as a whole when you combine these things together office and azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though office  has showed promise its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of windows desktops  so please be careful its no surprise they had layoffs recently despite most of them being in the nokia division because of the nokia merger still a considerable chunk of few people in redmond even top performers were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in they were forced to leave or reinterview for a new positions in the company which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs a similar approach was used in  it was devastating to morale coupled with the layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year really would not recommend anybody apply to microsoft at least until late   the company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self more efficient but its too soon to tell what that really means some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their worklife balance while at the same time they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours  none of this is encouraging luckily these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance  so now is definitely *not* the time to consider microsoft look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late  is my humble recommendationworking  microsoft can be out of this world especially main campus there is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience the diversity of people be it cultures age groups backgrounds genders education is amazing even the products that microsoft creates is diverse compare that with google or facebook who only make advertising revenuemy seven years at microsoft	__label__2.0

the dynamics division of microsoft which represents the  acquisition of great plains and  acquisition of navision has yet to completely feel like what i understand the experience to be in other divisions of microsoft the biggest thing i noticed is the leadership there are many that are not the caliber of professional you would expect from a vp or gm of microsoft  the strategy of the dynamics division is like dealing with an adhd child highlevel strategy can change as soon as every six months and midlevel strategy can change as often as every quarter  i have worked at microsoft twice the first time was as an employee of one of the abovementioned acquisitions they made it was one of the worst experiences of my professional career mainly due to the fact that microsoft executive management allowed only one of the two erp companies they acquired to manage the entire division and did not police them at all my supposedly strategic team of  was laid off a few years later  about  years later i found myself back at microsoft dynamics division with information that the internal product fighting was gone so i thought it would be safe unfortunately the top management of my particular group was horrible and after two years i decided to leave again i recently heard that hr finally acted on three years of negative feedback on these managers from their employees and removed them from power but it was too late for me and many others  the worst thing that applies to all of microsoft is their annual review methodology each team manager is required to pick a percentage of their team for a high score a percentage for a medium score and another percentage for a low score even if a manager had a team of superstars they would be forced to grade this way it creates a lot of back stabbing and politics  one last irritating thing is the blind loyalty they expect everyone to have toward their products i understand the importance of supporting your employer by purchasing their products but what if they produce inferior products when the ipod first came out it was an unspoken taboo to own an ipod and not a zune or some other mp player later when microsoft got into the cell phone business they became very anti iphone and android if they caught you with one you would no longer get your monthly  phone allowance even though microsoft has absolutely sucked in this market  overall microsoft is not the worst place to work and is probably great for some people it certainly looks impressive on a resume but i will not return thereunparalleled healthcare  everything is free no premiums no deductibles no copays however employees may start contributing to their health premium costs due to obamacare in  or   very sharp people work there the general attitude of my former colleagues is to think proactively to new trends and technologies and not be a follower i have worked for competitors who always consider what microsoft is doing with regards to adopting something new  when you work for microsoft the respect you feel in a room among others in the technology industry is a nice perkmicrosofts dynamics division is not the same experience as the rest of microsoft	__label__3.0

its been said so many times but the competitive stackranking review process is toxic and broken while engineering management pays lots of lipservice to teamwork and collaboration when it comes down to actual execution employees are rightly more concerned with individual achievement and the everelusive visibility in order to get high review scores which translates into promotions and potentially lots of monetary reward  for pms in particular the stackrank reviews cause people to either consciously or unconsciously overengineer product features to have more crossteam dependencies and greater complexity since this leads to increased visibility and scope people are rewarded for this regardless of success or failure of the productfeature  the fact is that individual work requirements and deliverables vary so widely that it hardly makes sense to compare them to each other  its an apples and oranges exercise attempting to apply the mythical manmonth to creative engineering roles is inherently folly  another side effect is that there ends up being a huge amount of collaborative and dependency overhead which limits teams agility and ability to deliver on short timelines in turn this prevents microsoft from being able to innovate or even fastfollow in an ever more dynamic technology market  microsoft has huge resources and influence but on the whole there are relatively few productsteams that are able to deliver real value to customers in a timely way the cashcows of windows and office continue to bolster the company financially ie nobody ever got fired for buying microsoft which is a good thing for keeping the company profitable and stable but it masks the fact that its a lumbering beast of a company thats finding it increasingly difficult to compete and stay relevant in emerging technology marketsdecent salary amazing benefits and perks bright and hardworking people and many opportunities to deliver products that are used by many millions of people some teams are customer and qualityfocused but not allbright people stimulating work toxic review process	__label__4.0

the main problem is that the best people are leaving and those who remain are less and less competent every year but dont seem to know that it seems that the best new hires dont want to work at microsoft and choose to go elsewhere  recognition and career success comes primarily from telling management what it wants to hear rather than from good work or doing what customers want in the past middle management was technically competent but mediocre at managing people which they knew but didnt care today management is too often poor on all dimensions but doesnt even know it many managers are incapable of recognizing good work much less knowing how to do it themselves or how to encourage people to deliver it managers take care of themselves and their peers first suppressing other opinions rather than standing up for employees  the company is a giant bureaucracy the easiest way to succeed at microsoft like any bureaucracy is to tell everyone what they want to hear keep your head down and dont challenge anything its better to do work that is tolerably good but not excellent because great work would be a threat to others this attitude seems to come down from the top where very real threats to the company are covered up in platitudes about how next year will be great year after year after year  having said this the culture varies from group to group some are awful while others can be supportive and good places to work however its impossible to know in advance what any group is like and continual reorganizations every six months on average mean that it could change at any moment and go from great to terrible with no warning  another major problem is the review system employees are forced onto curves within their groups regardless of the groups overall strength and managers are able to pick and choose peer feedback to punish anyone they wish if you happen to end with a manager who doesnt like you or feels threatened then you will get a bad review and only the most recent review counts for anything even with a string of great reviews if the most recent one is bad you will be unable to look for other jobs within the company thus a single bad manager effectively can force you out of the company this explains why employees worry so much more about telling managers what they want rather than doing great work  given increasingly incompetent management flat stock price and disincentives for excellent work its no surprise that the best employees are leaving in droves for amazon facebook zynga startups and pretty much anywhere they can the primary barrier to the exodus is that there are not many options in seattle  in short if you would like a nice office and benefits but dont care that much about your work or career path or if you prefer to play politics and dont mind backstabbing others then microsoft could be a good place for you but if you want to excel to do something interesting or to be rewarded for real innovation its the wrong placebenefits such as health insurance are excellent although they are being slowly whittled away the seattle area location is good because the cost of living is lower than california the company has money to burn so getting approval for equipment or travel is no problem most permanent employees still get private offices although thats changing and is group dependentquality of employees is plummeting and only groupthink is rewarded	__label__2.0

 the review system is not fair in the sense that the leadership team makes decisions based on their impressions of contribution of a team member whereas your manager and colleagues you work with on a project may know a lot better about your level of performance coupled with the brutal stack ranking system and rewarding the top  the most what this means is that you will get really burned if you think all you need to do is churn out great code and work well with your teammates to release a good product you need to actually spend time with leadership team let everyone know what you are doing etc so that you stay in the radar of the leadership team  this also means that there are very driven smart people who end up focusing more on career growth rather than releasing a great product   company is very big so a fair number of employees are bound to be quite mediocre they really try to make sure that is not the case with developers though but you can always find some useless testers or test leads in every team   program managers who are not product focused but spend more time and energy on pleasing the leadership with presentations a lot of things are taken care so that developers can focus on coding program managers handle requirement facing customers talking to other teams etc and priority is given so that you can focus on programming and producing results  for the technicalnonmanager types if you are patient and can deal with occasional politics at the office and have potential to be a product architect there is really room to grow here i hear at other companies that there is a ceiling for technical types but here there isnt they have career stage setup all the way from senior sde to architect distinguished engineer to technical fellow of course extremely few people amongst the talented employees of microsoft make it to level beyond architect but that path is there  in general if you are proactive there is a lot of support you can get to learn how to grow and succeed at microsoft in the form of mentoringcomfortable career but not a place if you want to learn a lot and grow fast	__label__3.0

 good technical folks who dont necessarily have people skills are often promoted to management this leads to poor managing and often hamper the success of their employees  the common understanding at microsoft is that employees have to create their own visibility in order to stand out and get promoted just doing really good work is not enough to be recognized you have to give presentations fix urgent customer bugs and be sure someone in management sends mass emails acknowledging you and make sure that everyone knows who you are and how great you are unfortunately this often fosters and environment of individual competitiveness in which you must focus solely on your own success without regard for that of your team or coworkers  the advertised mentorship program when a more experienced employee mentors a relatively new one is played up as a strong positive but most of the socalled mentors are too busy or lack the needed people skills to have any effect  with such a large organization the exact whats and hows often come down from upper management leaving the individual contributer to simply execute commands given them they often have almost no say in what should be done or how best to do it this like many of the other cons depends on the specific product group but it is very common and prevalent enough to be of concern to anyone looking to work for microsoft  certain managers make  of the decisions around the whats whens and hows of employee work without being open to any feedback from the employee  teamwork takes a backseat to individual success prestigious company to work for looks great on resume  good pay  really interesting projects and technology that you can get your hands on  great place for competitive types who are driven the desire to outperform others rather than the success of their team  huge company with lots of divisions so ample opportunity to move around among product groupsgood for competitive people but not for those who prefer teamoriented work environments	__label__2.0

but its not all rosy there are certainly a lot of things to be aware of if you have never worked at microsoft  when i joined i was surprised by a few things about the organization   its true that promotions are hard to come by you could go on for years with pretty good annual reviews but still not be promoted for various reasons this is incredibly frustrating and had i known this earlier i would have done more then rather than to learn it after several years but i believe it takes a certain type of person you need to know how to manage upwards extremely well talk to your manager be firm about what you want and when be incredibly focused on what moves the needle and have great impact and influence on others its easy to be distracted on other things   it takes a long time to get things done because its such a large organization great ideas take time to cultivate and turn into solid strategy priorities and action items there are so many people to get buyin from but if you build the relationships and understand how the system works you learn to factor that into your daily work and projects if you come from an entrepreneurial background and you are used to doing things quickly or on a whim to test out etc then i would caution you to think hard about this get used to simple things sometimes taking months to complete   there are a lot of managers here who dont do a good job of balancing both their individual contributions with their managerial responsibilities its definitely hard because a manager wants their team to perform well but they also want to contribute directly to the organizations success balancing this effectively is hard and few do it very wellthis perspective is from the online services division specifically the ad platform teams  similar to many other reviews it is nice that we have beautiful offices pretty decent compensation more on this later and super smart people  unlike many other divisions microsoft is not the dominant force in this particular industry so the varied stereotypes of a monopolistic microsoft or large company intent on a closed software system here do not necessarily hold true you can see that in conversations with customers they want us to do well they want us to be a strong viable competitor to the other big players in the online advertising industry this is a huge plus when it comes to the willingness of customers to work with us especially given our big name it also manifests in a strong focus and collaboration among the dedicated engineering business group and sales teams its a pro in the sense that the advertising business needs to be an open ecosystem and that is refreshing if youve never worked here before  one other pro that ill mention is the fact that there is incredible talent in the strategy teams theres a ton of great strategic work going on here that you can get behind and use as your north star knowing that executives are working hard to make sure were wellpositioned in the industry makes the work all the more worthwhile that determination is clear throughout the organizationyou learn to appreciate what working for microsoft really means	__label__3.0
